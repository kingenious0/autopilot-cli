# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Autopilot CLI, please report it to us immediately.

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report vulnerabilities by emailing **praise@praisetech.zw** (or the current maintainer).

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will provide a timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
