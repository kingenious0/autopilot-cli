## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Stability**: Fixed a crash in `autopilot dashboard` caused by incorrect named import of `getRunningPid`.
- **Command Reliability**: Added regression tests for `dashboard`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, and `status` commands to ensure stability.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **Safety System (Phase 1)**:
  - **Undo/Rollback**: `autopilot undo` command to safely revert the last autopilot commit.
  - **Team Mode**: Enhanced `autopilot init` with team configuration. Implements "Pull-Before-Push" to prevent conflicts.
  - **Pre-Commit Validation**:
    - **Secret Detection**: Blocks commits containing AWS, GitHub, or Stripe keys.
    - **File Size Check**: Prevents committing files larger than 50MB.
    - **Quality Gates**: Optional linting and test execution before commit.
  - **Pause/Resume**: `autopilot pause` and `autopilot resume` for manual control of the automation loop.
- **Visibility & UX (Phase 2)**:
  - **Real-Time Dashboard**: `autopilot dashboard` providing a live view of file changes, last commit status, and system health.
  - **Enhanced Insights**: `autopilot insights` with deep analytics:
    - Commit Quality Score (0-100) based on conventional commit standards.
    - Productivity metrics (peak hours, streaks).
    - CSV export capability (`--export csv`).
- **Intelligence (Phase 3)**:
  - **AI Commit Messages**: Integration with Google Gemini for context-aware, senior-level commit message generation.
  - **Workflow Presets**: `autopilot preset` command to quickly switch between workflows:
    - `safe-team`: Optimized for collaboration (Team Mode + Secret Checks).
    - `solo-speed`: Optimized for rapid individual development.
    - `strict-ci`: Enforces testing and linting before every commit.
### Docs/Website
- Added Leaderboard page with live simulated rankings.
- Updated homepage Feature Showcase to demonstrate Insights and Safety & Team features.
- Added Leaderboard to top navigation.
- Updated Introduction docs to highlight v2.0 features (AI, Focus Engine, Team Mode, Safety Net).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-04

### Reliability & Core
- **Watcher Engine Overhaul**:
  - Implemented dual ignore checks (chokidar + internal matcher) to guarantee no ignored files trigger builds.
  - Added "Max Wait" fallback (60s) to prevent debounce starvation on busy repos.
  - Hardcoded critical ignores (`.git`, `node_modules`, `autopilot.log`) to prevent infinite loops.
- **Git Safety**:
  - Added graceful fallback for push failures (logs warning instead of crashing).
  - Enforced "tracked only" commits using `git status --porcelain`.
- **Test Mode**:
  - Added `AUTOPILOT_TEST_MODE=1` flag for deterministic CI testing (foreground run + auto-exit).

### CI/CD & Standards
- **GitHub Workflows**:
  - `ci.yml`: Automated testing on Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS for every PR.
  - `release.yml`: Automated GitHub Releases with changelog generation and tarball assets.
  - `publish.yml`: Secure npm publishing via OIDC provenance.
- **Repository Standards**:
  - Added Issue Templates (Bug/Feature), PR Template, `SECURITY.md`, and `CODEOWNERS`.

### Fixed
- **Windows Paths**: Fixed path normalization issues causing ignore rules to fail on Windows.
- **Self-Triggering**: Fixed issue where writing `autopilot.log` could trigger a new commit loop.
