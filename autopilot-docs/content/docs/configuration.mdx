description: Customize Autopilot CLI behavior using configuration files.
---

Autopilot CLI is designed to be zero-config out of the box, but it also offers powerful customization options to fit your workflow. You can configure Autopilot using `.autopilotrc.json` for behavior settings and `.autopilotignore` for file exclusion.

## .autopilotrc.json

The `.autopilotrc.json` file in your project root controls how Autopilot monitors and commits changes.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `minInterval` | `number` | `300` | Minimum time (in seconds) between automatic commits. Useful for debouncing rapid changes. |
| `autoPush` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to automatically push commits to the remote repository. |
| `blockedBranches` | `string[]` | `['main', 'master']` | List of branches where Autopilot is disabled to prevent accidental direct commits to protected branches. |
| `requireChecks` | `boolean` | `false` | If `true`, Autopilot will wait for local checks (like pre-commit hooks) to pass before committing. |
| `ignore` | `string[]` | `[]` | Additional glob patterns to ignore, supplementing `.gitignore` and `.autopilotignore`. |
| `ai` | `object` | `{}` | Configuration for AI features (see below). |
| `team` | `object` | `{}` | Configuration for Team features (see below). |

### AI Configuration & Privacy Disclosure

Autopilot supports optional integration with **Google Gemini** or **xAI Grok** to generate context-aware commit messages.

> **Privacy Disclosure:** AI features are **disabled by default**. They are purely assistive and optional.

#### Data Usage Transparency

If (and only if) you explicitly enable AI and provide your own API key:
1.  **What is sent**: Autopilot sends the **text diff** of your staged changes to the API provider (Google or xAI) to generate a summary.
2.  **What is NOT sent**: We do not send your entire codebase, your history, or your file contents (other than the diff).
3.  **No Training**: We do not store, proxy, or train on your code. The interaction is directly between your local machine and the AI provider.
4.  **No Ranking Impact**: Using AI does not affect your productivity stats or leaderboard ranking.

#### AI Settings

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "gemini", 
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "interactive": false
  }
}
```

*   **enabled**: Toggle AI features on/off (default: `false`).
*   **provider**: Choose between `gemini` (default) or `grok`.
*   **apiKey**: Your personal API Key.
*   **model**: Specific model to use.
*   **interactive**: If `true`, prompts you to review/edit the generated message before committing.

### Team Configuration

Settings to ensure smooth collaboration.

```json
{
  "team": {
    "pullBeforePush": true,
    "preventSecrets": true,
    "preventLargeFiles": true
  }
}
```

*   **pullBeforePush**: Automatically runs `git pull --rebase` before pushing to avoid conflicts.
*   **preventSecrets**: Scans for AWS, Stripe, and GitHub keys before committing.
*   **preventLargeFiles**: Blocks commits containing files larger than 50MB.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "minInterval": 600,
  "autoPush": true,
  "blockedBranches": ["main", "production"],
  "requireChecks": true,
  "ai": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interactive": true
  }
}
```

## .autopilotignore

Just like `.gitignore`, you can use an `.autopilotignore` file to tell Autopilot which files or directories to skip. This is useful for files that you want to track in Git but **don't** want Autopilot to commit automatically (e.g., specific config files, large assets, or work-in-progress drafts).

The syntax is standard glob patterns:

```text
# Ignore all markdown files in the drafts folder
docs/drafts/*.md

# Ignore a specific config file
local-config.json

# Ignore all log files
*.log
```

> **Note:** Autopilot **always** respects your `.gitignore` file. You do not need to duplicate entries from `.gitignore` into `.autopilotignore`.

## Recommended Defaults

For most users, we recommend the following safety settings to balance automation with control:

1.  **Protect Main Branches:** Always keep `main` and `master` in `blockedBranches`. Use Autopilot on feature branches.
2.  **Reasonable Interval:** A `minInterval` of `300` (5 minutes) is usually a good balance. It ensures you have a granular history without overwhelming your log.
3.  **Enable Checks:** If you use pre-commit hooks (husky, etc.), set `requireChecks: true` to ensure you don't commit broken code.

## Use Case Examples

### "Commit Only" Mode

If you want Autopilot to create local checkpoints but **never push** to remote automatically (e.g., if you have strict CI/CD that runs on push), use this config:

```json
{
  "autoPush": false,
  "minInterval": 300
}
```

### "Aggressive Sync" Mode

For rapid prototyping or personal projects where you want every change saved and synced immediately:

```json
{
  "autoPush": true,
  "minInterval": 60,
  "blockedBranches": []
}
```
