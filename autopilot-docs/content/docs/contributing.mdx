We love contributions! Whether it's fixing a bug, improving documentation, or proposing a new feature, your help is welcome.

## Development Setup

1.  **Fork and Clone**
    Clone your fork of the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/autopilot-cli.git
    cd autopilot-cli
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    We use `npm` for dependency management.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Tests**
    Ensure everything is working correctly before you start.
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

4.  **Link Locally**
    To test the CLI on your machine while developing:
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```
    Now you can run `autopilot` in any other directory to test your changes.

## Branch Naming & Commits

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests
Run the standard unit test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests
Integration tests run the actual CLI against a temporary git repository. These are slower but essential for verifying git operations.

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

> **Note:** Integration tests may require a working git installation and internet access if checking remote operations.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your PR, please ensure:

-   [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm test`).
-   [ ] You have added tests for any new functionality.
-   [ ] You have updated the documentation if user-facing behavior changed.
-   [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines.
-   [ ] Commit messages are descriptive.

## Code Style

-   **Clean Code:** Keep functions small and focused.
-   **Comments:** Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code (clear variable names) over excessive comments.
-   **Signature:** Please preserve the signature line in the main entry point if it exists.
-   **Formatting:** We use Prettier. Run `npm run format` before committing.
