# Installation

Getting started with Autopilot CLI is straightforward. Since it's a Node.js-based tool, you can install it using your favorite package manager.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version **18.0.0** or higher is required.
- **Git**: Autopilot relies on your system's git installation to perform operations.

You can check your current Node.js version by running:

```bash
node --version
```

## Global Installation

We recommend installing Autopilot globally so you can use the `autopilot` command from any project directory.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install -g @traisetech/autopilot
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn global add @traisetech/autopilot
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g @traisetech/autopilot
```

## Verify Installation

Once installed, verify that the command is available by checking the help menu:

```bash
autopilot --help
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```text
Usage: autopilot [options] [command]

Intelligent Git automation that commits and pushes your code

Options:
  -V, --version   output the version number
  -h, --help      display help for command

Commands:
  init            Initialize Autopilot in the current directory
  start           Start the file watcher
  status          Check the status of the Autopilot daemon
  stop            Stop the Autopilot daemon
  help [command]  display help for command
```

## Troubleshooting

### Windows PATH Issues

If you see an error like `'autopilot' is not recognized as an internal or external command` after installation, it usually means your npm global binaries folder is not in your system's `PATH`.

**To fix this on Windows:**

1.  Open **System Properties** (search for "Edit the system environment variables").
2.  Click **Environment Variables**.
3.  Under **User variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
4.  Look for a path ending in `npm` or `nodejs`. It is often:
    *   `%APPDATA%\npm`
    *   `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\npm`
5.  If it's missing, click **New** and add the path to your roaming npm folder.
6.  Click **OK** on all windows.
7.  **Restart your terminal** (or VS Code) for changes to take effect.

### Permission Errors (EACCES)

On macOS or Linux, if you receive a permission error during global installation, you may need to use `sudo` or fix your npm permissions.

**Using sudo (quick fix):**

```bash
sudo npm install -g @traisetech/autopilot
```

**Fixing permissions (recommended):**

We recommend using a version manager like `nvm` or `fnm` which handles permissions automatically without needing `sudo`.

## Uninstalling

If you need to remove Autopilot CLI from your system:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @traisetech/autopilot
```

This will remove the global binary but will **not** delete any `.autopilotrc.json` configuration files you created in your projects. You can safely delete those manually if desired.
