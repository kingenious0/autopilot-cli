# Productivity & Leaderboard

Autopilot isn't just a commit tool—it's a productivity engine. The built-in **Focus Engine** tracks your coding activity, file modifications, and "in-the-zone" time to provide deep insights into your work habits.

## The `insights` Command

Run `autopilot insights` to see your personal productivity dashboard directly in your terminal.

```bash
autopilot insights
```

### Key Metrics

*   **Commit Quality Score**: An AI-generated score (0-100) that evaluates your commit messages against Conventional Commits standards.
*   **Focus Time**: Total time spent actively editing files.
*   **Peak Hours**: A histogram showing when you are most productive.
*   **Active Streaks**: Consecutive days with coding activity.

## Your Personal Leaderboard

While Autopilot is a local-first tool, you can export your data to create your own leaderboards or share stats with your team.

### Exporting Data

You can export your session data to a CSV file for analysis in Excel, Google Sheets, or custom dashboards.

```bash
autopilot insights --export csv
```

This generates an `autopilot-insights.csv` file containing:
*   Timestamp
*   Event Type (File Change, Commit, Push)
*   File Path
*   Duration

### Gamifying Your Workflow

Autopilot encourages better habits through "Nudges" and "Micro-Goals".

*   **Nudges**: If you've been editing a file for a long time without committing, Autopilot will gently "nudge" you to save your work.
*   **Micro-Goals**: (Coming Soon) Set daily targets for commits or focus time.

## Dashboard Visualization

For a real-time visual representation of your activity, use the dashboard command:

```bash
autopilot dashboard
```

This opens a live TUI (Text User Interface) showing:
1.  **Status**: Current watcher state (Running/Paused).
2.  **Recent Activity**: Live log of file changes.
3.  **Next Action**: Countdown to the next auto-commit.
