# Quick Start

Follow these steps to start automating your Git workflow.

## 1. Initialize

Navigate to your Git repository and initialize Autopilot:

```bash
cd my-project
autopilot init
```

This will create a default `.autopilotrc.json` and `.autopilotignore` file in your project root.

## 2. Start Watching

Start the background daemon to begin monitoring your files:

```bash
autopilot start
```

Autopilot is now running in the background! Any changes you make will be automatically committed and pushed (after a debounce period).

## 3. Check Status

Verify that Autopilot is running:

```bash
autopilot status
```

## 4. Stop

When you're done for the day or want to stop automation:

```bash
autopilot stop
```
