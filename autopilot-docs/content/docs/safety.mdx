# Safety Features

Autopilot includes several safety mechanisms to prevent accidents and ensure repository integrity.

## 1. Blocked Branches

Autopilot refuses to commit on branches listed in `blockedBranches` (default: `main`, `master`). This prevents accidental direct commits to production or protected branches.

## 2. Remote Ahead Protection

Before performing actions, Autopilot fetches and checks if the remote branch is ahead of your local branch. If it is, Autopilot pauses and logs a warning, instructing you to pull changes first. This prevents merge conflicts.

## 3. Required Checks

If `requireChecks` is enabled in configuration, the commands specified in `checks` must pass (exit code 0) before a commit is created. This ensures you don't commit broken code.

## 4. Debounce + Rate Limiting

- **Debouncing**: `debounceSeconds` ensures Autopilot waits for you to stop typing/saving before checking status.
- **Rate Limiting**: `minSecondsBetweenCommits` prevents creating too many commits in a short period.

## 5. Ignore Patterns

- **.autopilotignore**: Supports standard glob patterns to exclude files.
- **Built-in Ignores**: `.git`, `.autopilot.pid`, `autopilot.log`, and `.vscode/` (specific noise files) are automatically ignored.

## 6. Graceful Errors

Errors are handled without crashing the watcher. Warnings are printed to the console, and verbose details are written to `autopilot.log`.

## 7. PID Tracking

The watcher writes a `.autopilot.pid` file in the repository root on start and removes it on exit. This ensures only one instance of Autopilot runs per repository at a time.
