If you run into issues with Autopilot CLI, this guide will help you diagnose and fix them.

## First Steps: The Doctor

Before diving into specific issues, run the built-in diagnostic tool. It checks your environment, git configuration, and permissions.

```bash
autopilot doctor
```

If `autopilot doctor` reports all green checks but you still have issues, check the specific scenarios below.

## Common Issues

### Autopilot detects changes but never commits

**Symptoms:** You see "Change detected" logs repeatedly, but no commit is ever created.

**Cause:** This is usually caused by "noisy" files that change constantly (e.g., every second), which constantly resets the debounce timer. If the timer never finishes, the commit never happens.

**Common Culprits:**
-   VS Code time tracking extensions (writing to a local file).
-   Build artifacts or hot-reload cache files not ignored.
-   Log files being written to the source directory.

**Fix:**
Add the noisy files to your `.autopilotignore` or `.gitignore`.

```text
# .autopilotignore
.vscode/arduino.json
**/*.log
dist/
```

### Push fails or "Authentication failed"

**Symptoms:** Autopilot commits locally but fails to push to the remote.

**Cause:** Autopilot uses your system's `git` credentials. If you haven't set up an SSH key or a credential helper (like `git-credential-manager`), background pushes might fail because they can't prompt for a password.

**Fix:**
Ensure you can run `git push` manually in your terminal without being asked for a password.
-   **SSH:** Set up an SSH key and add it to GitHub/GitLab.
-   **HTTPS:** Use a credential helper to cache your token.

### Autopilot start crashes immediately

**Symptoms:** You run `autopilot start` and it exits with an error.

**Cause:**
1.  **Node Version:** Autopilot requires Node.js v18+.
2.  **Corrupted Install:** Sometimes global packages get into a bad state.

**Fix:**
Check your node version:
```bash
node -v
# Should be v18.0.0 or higher
```

Reinstall the package:
```bash
npm uninstall -g autopilot-cli
npm install -g autopilot-cli
```

### Stop or Status commands aren't working

**Symptoms:** `autopilot status` says "Running" but it isn't, or `autopilot stop` says "No process found".

**Cause:** The `.autopilot.pid` file (which stores the process ID) might be stale. This happens if the computer crashed or the process was killed forcefully (e.g., via Task Manager) without cleaning up.

**Fix:**
Manually delete the PID file to reset the state.

```bash
rm .autopilot.pid
```

## Debugging Tools

### Manual Git Check

Autopilot relies on `git status` to detect changes. You can see exactly what Autopilot sees by running:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If this command returns nothing, Autopilot assumes there is nothing to commit.

### Log Files

Autopilot writes detailed logs to `autopilot.log` in your project root. This file contains timestamps of every detection, commit, and error.

```bash
tail -f autopilot.log
```

Reviewing the last few lines of this file often reveals the exact error message from Git or the system.
